Features:
 - Custom categories
 - Automatic splitting, controlled by supported trigger types (Position, Boss appearing, Boss dying, Raid starting/ending)
 - Remember selected category
 - Visual appearance settings (number of shown splits, additional timing information, scale)
 - Support for English and German
 - WR submission Form (https://forms.gle/nWWNyjJC6ZhJj3yz7)


TODO:
 - Manual Mode / Autosplit bypass
 - BRP, MA, VH support
 - Stipped build, without debugger lines and luadoc
 - CenterAnnounceTrigger
 - Do not commit split times before run is over (in case there were wrong splits)
 - Having the inventory open (UI hidden) breaks autosplitting
 - SplitRow desc length overflowing into timer element

Issues:
FG2 Mephala Spawn, what if player is in cave when boss dies?
FG2 Endboss sometimes does not have a healthbar, need to investigate
Wayrest1 Last boss no HP bar??
